            <p>Hi, I'm Patricia Anne Ilano, I'm a web developer, I started my career in 2016, doing projects using the latest technology trends. I am fascinated with how things work in the web and I'm eager to learn new skills towards achieving the goals that I set.</p>
            <p>On my free time, I enjoy reading, taking photos and videos of random things, watching TV series, foreign and indie films, exploring places and natural wonders.</p>
            <p>I write about web development, my travels, books and art. </p>
            <p style="display:none;">I have a passion on making things work and for them to have their own purpose, to make something useful for the world, a supplement for which it can get what it needs.  </p>
            <p>I'm also looking for opportunity which I can exert my skills and experience, please visit my <a href="/cv">CV</a> section to know my qualification.</p>
